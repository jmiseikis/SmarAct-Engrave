Engraving using SmarAct Linear Positioner
=====================

One of the weekly projects completed at university to control precise SmarAct ( http://www.smaract.de/ ) 
linear positioners to engrave miniature letters into a painted plate. It required a precise 
controller, path planning and actuator control with error checking. Trajectory is taken from
the coords.dat file.

Project was done together with Nina Sauthoff and Matthias Wueest.

Dependencies:
* SmarAct libraries
* qt4
